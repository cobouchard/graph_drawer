# graph_drawer

The goal was to provide an educationnal tool capable of creating and visualating graphs and showing the results of different algorithms on graphs

## Implemented
<ol>
  <li>Creating a graph with mouse and keyboard, updating weight of edges</li>
  <li>Saving/reloading a graph to/from a file</li>
  <li>Managing oriented/unoriented graphs, unweighted graphs are graphs where all edges have a weight of 1</li>
  <li>Some algorithms BFS, DFS, Kruskal, useful functions and tests on graphs</li>
</ol> 

## Not implemented
<ol>
  <li>Displaying results in a new window</li>
  <li>Display difference between oriented and unoriented graphs</li>
  <li>Many more useful algorithms</li>
</ol>
